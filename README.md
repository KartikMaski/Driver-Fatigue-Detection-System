# drowsiness_yawn.py Script Features

### Key Features:
1. **Real-Time Monitoring**:
   - Captures video from a webcam to monitor the driver's face and behavior.
   
2. **Drowsiness Detection**:
   - **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) Calculation**: Measures eye closure to detect drowsiness.
   - **Consecutive Frame Counting**: Tracks frames with low EAR to confirm drowsiness.

3. **Yawn Detection**:
   - **Lip Distance Measurement**: Measures the distance between upper and lower lips to detect yawning.
   - **Threshold Comparison**: Identifies yawns based on a predefined distance threshold.

4. **Alert Mechanisms**:
   - **Auditory Alerts**: Uses `espeak` for spoken warnings.
   - **Buzzer Alerts**: Activates a buzzer connected to a Raspberry Pi for physical alerts.
   - **Visual Alerts**: Displays warning messages on the video feed.

5. **Camera Coverage Detection**:
   - Monitors if the camera is covered and provides visual feedback if no faces are detected for a prolonged period.

6. **Facial Landmark Detection**:
   - Uses dlib's facial landmark predictor for precise eye and lip measurements.

7. **Customizability**:
   - Adjustable thresholds and parameters for detection sensitivity.

8. **Threaded Alerts**:
   - Utilizes threading to handle alerts without interrupting the main detection process.

9. **Integration with GPIO**:
   - Controls a buzzer using Raspberry Pi GPIO pins for additional alerting.

### Usage:
- **Run the Script**: `python drowsiness_yawn.py --webcam webcam_index`
- **Monitor Alerts**: Respond to auditory, visual, and physical alerts when signs of drowsiness or yawning are detected.

By following these instructions and utilizing the provided script, users can effectively monitor and respond to signs of driver drowsiness, enhancing road safety and preventing fatigue-related accidents.
